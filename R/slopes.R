#' Slopes (aka Partial derivatives, Marginal Effects, or Trends)
#'
#' @description
#' Partial derivative of the regression equation with respect to a regressor of interest.
#'
#' * `slopes()`: unit-level (conditional) estimates.
#' * `avg_slopes()`: average (marginal) estimates.
#'
#' The `newdata` argument and the `datagrid()` function can be used to control where statistics are evaluated in the predictor space: "at observed values", "at the mean", "at representative values", etc.

#'
#' @details
#' A "slope" or "marginal effect" is the partial derivative of the regression equation
#' with respect to a variable in the model. This function uses automatic
#' differentiation to compute slopes for a vast array of models,
#' including non-linear models with transformations (e.g., polynomials).
#' Uncertainty estimates are computed using the delta method.
#'
#' @param model Model object
#' @param variables Focal variables
#' * `NULL`: compute slopes or comparisons for all the variables in the model object (can be slow).
#' * Character vector: subset of variables (usually faster).
#' @param newdata Grid of predictor values at which we evaluate the slopes.
#' + Warning: Please avoid modifying your dataset between fitting the model and calling a `marginaleffects` function. This can sometimes lead to unexpected results.
#' + `NULL` (default): Unit-level slopes for each observed value in the dataset (empirical distribution). The dataset is retrieved using [insight::get_data()], which tries to extract data from the environment. This may produce unexpected results if the original data frame has been altered since fitting the model.
#' + [datagrid()] call to specify a custom grid of regressors. For example:
#'   - `newdata = datagrid(cyl = c(4, 6))`: `cyl` variable equal to 4 and 6 and other regressors fixed at their means or modes.
#'   - See the Examples section and the [datagrid()] documentation.
#' + [subset()] call with a single argument to select a subset of the dataset used to fit the model, ex: `newdata = subset(treatment == 1)`
#' + [dplyr::filter()] call with a single argument to select a subset of the dataset used to fit the model, ex: `newdata = filter(treatment == 1)`
#' + string:
#'   - "mean": Slopes evaluated when each predictor is held at its mean or mode.
#'   - "median": Slopes evaluated when each predictor is held at its median or mode.
#'   - "balanced": Slopes evaluated on a balanced grid with every combination of categories and numeric variables held at their means.
#'   - "tukey": Slopes evaluated at Tukey's 5 numbers.
#'   - "grid": Slopes evaluated on a grid of representative numbers (Tukey's 5 numbers and unique values of categorical predictors).
#' @param vcov Type of uncertainty estimates to report (e.g., for robust standard errors). Acceptable values:
#'  * FALSE: Do not compute standard errors. This can speed up computation considerably.
#'  * TRUE: Unit-level standard errors using the default `vcov(model)` variance-covariance matrix.
#'  * String which indicates the kind of uncertainty estimates to return.
#'    - Heteroskedasticity-consistent: `"HC"`, `"HC0"`, `"HC1"`, `"HC2"`, `"HC3"`, `"HC4"`, `"HC4m"`, `"HC5"`. See `?sandwich::vcovHC`
#'    - Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent: `"HAC"`
#'    - Mixed-Models degrees of freedom: "satterthwaite", "kenward-roger"
#'    - Other: `"NeweyWest"`, `"KernHAC"`, `"OPG"`. See the `sandwich` package documentation.
#'  * One-sided formula which indicates the name of cluster variables (e.g., `~unit_id`). This formula is passed to the `cluster` argument of the `sandwich::vcovCL` function.
#'  * Square covariance matrix
#'  * Function which returns a covariance matrix (e.g., `stats::vcov(model)`)
#' @param conf_level numeric value between 0 and 1. Confidence level to use to build a confidence interval.
#' @param type string indicates the type (scale) of the predictions used to
#' compute contrasts or slopes. This can differ based on the model
#' type, but will typically be a string such as: "response", "link", "probs",
#' or "zero". When an unsupported string is entered, the model-specific list of
#' acceptable values is returned in an error message. When `type` is `NULL`, the
#' first entry in the error message is used by default.
#' @param slope string indicates the type of slope or (semi-)elasticity to compute:
#' - "dydx": dY/dX
#' - "eyex": dY/dX * Y / X
#' - "eydx": dY/dX * Y
#' - "dyex": dY/dX / X
#' - Y is the predicted value of the outcome; X is the observed value of the predictor.
#' @param wts logical, string or numeric: weights to use when computing average predictions, contrasts or slopes. These weights only affect the averaging in `avg_*()` or with the `by` argument, and not unit-level estimates. See `?weighted.mean`
#' + string: column name of the weights variable in `newdata`. When supplying a column name to `wts`, it is recommended to supply the original data (including the weights variable) explicitly to `newdata`.
#' + numeric: vector of length equal to the number of rows in the original data or in `newdata` (if supplied).
#' + FALSE: Equal weights.
#' + TRUE: Extract weights from the fitted object with `insight::find_weights()` and use them when taking weighted averages of estimates. Warning: `newdata=datagrid()` returns a single average weight, which is equivalent to using `wts=FALSE`
#' @param hypothesis specify a hypothesis test or custom contrast using a number , formula, string equation, vector, matrix, or function.
#' + Number: The null hypothesis used in the computation of Z and p (before applying `transform`).
#' + String: Equation to specify linear or non-linear hypothesis tests. If the terms in `coef(object)` uniquely identify estimates, they can be used in the formula. Otherwise, use `b1`, `b2`, etc. to identify the position of each parameter. The `b*` wildcard can be used to test hypotheses on all estimates. If a named vector is used, the names are used as labels in the output. Examples:
#'   - `hp = drat`
#'   - `hp + drat = 12`
#'   - `b1 + b2 + b3 = 0`
#'   - `b* / b1 = 1`
#' + Formula: `lhs ~ rhs | group`
#'   + `lhs`
#'     - `ratio`
#'     - `difference`
#'     - Leave empty for default value
#'   + `rhs`
#'     - `pairwise` and `revpairwise`: pairwise differences between estimates in each row.
#'     - `reference`: differences between the estimates in each row and the estimate in the first row.
#'     - `sequential`: difference between an estimate and the estimate in the next row.
#'     - `meandev`: difference between an estimate and the mean of all estimates.
#'     - `meanotherdev: difference between an estimate and the mean of all other estimates, excluding the current one.
#'     - `poly`: polynomial contrasts, as computed by the `stats::contr.poly()` function.
#'     - `helmert`: Helmert contrasts, as computed by the `stats::contr.helmert()` function. Contrast 2nd level to the first, 3rd to the average of the first two, and so on.
#'     - `trt_vs_ctrl`: difference between the mean of estimates (except the first) and the first estimate.
#'     - `I(fun(x))`: custom function to manipulate the vector of estimates `x`. The function `fun()` can return multiple (potentially named) estimates.
#'   + `group` (optional)
#'     - Column name of `newdata`. Conduct hypothesis tests withing subsets of the data.
#'   + Examples:
#'      + `~ poly`
#'      + `~ sequential | groupid`
#'      + `~ reference`
#'      + `ratio ~ pairwise`
#'      + `difference ~ pairwise | groupid`
#'      + `~ I(x - mean(x)) | groupid`
#'      + `~ I(\(x) c(a = x[1], b = mean(x[2:3]))) | groupid`
#' + Matrix or Vector: Each column is a vector of weights. The the output is the dot product between these vectors of weights and the vector of estimates. The matrix can have column names to label the estimates.
#' + Function:
#'   - Accepts an argument `x`: object produced by a `marginaleffects` function or a data frame with column `rowid` and `estimate`
#'   - Returns a data frame with columns `term` and `estimate` (mandatory) and `rowid` (optional).
#'   - The function can also accept optional input arguments: `newdata`, `by`, `draws`.
#'   - This function approach will not work for Bayesian models or with bootstrapping. In those cases, it is easy to use `get_draws()` to extract and manipulate the draws directly.
#' + See the Examples section below and the vignette: [https://marginaleffects.com/chapters/hypothesis.html](https://marginaleffects.com/chapters/hypothesis.html)
#' @param df Degrees of freedom used to compute p values and confidence intervals. A single numeric value between 1 and `Inf`. When `df` is `Inf`, the normal distribution is used. When `df` is finite, the `t` distribution is used. See [insight::get_df] for a convenient function to extract degrees of freedom. Ex: `slopes(model, df = insight::get_df(model))`
#' @param eps NULL or numeric value which determines the step size to use when
#' calculating numerical derivatives: (f(x+eps)-f(x))/eps. When `eps` is
#' `NULL`, the step size is 0.0001 multiplied by the difference between
#' the maximum and minimum values of the variable with respect to which we
#' are taking the derivative. Changing `eps` may be necessary to avoid
#' numerical problems in certain models.
#' @param numderiv string or list of strings indicating the method to use to for the numeric differentiation used in to compute delta method standard errors.
#' + "fdforward": finite difference method with forward differences
#' + "fdcenter": finite difference method with central differences (default)
#' + "richardson": Richardson extrapolation method
#' + Extra arguments can be specified by passing a list to the `numDeriv` argument, with the name of the method first and named arguments following, ex: `numderiv=list("fdcenter", eps = 1e-5)`. When an unknown argument is used, `marginaleffects` prints the list of valid arguments for each method.
#' @param ... Additional arguments are passed to the `predict()` method
#' supplied by the modeling package.These arguments are particularly useful
#' for mixed-effects or bayesian models (see the online vignettes on the
#' `marginaleffects` website). Available arguments can vary from model to
#' model, depending on the range of supported arguments by each modeling
#' package. See the "Model-Specific Arguments" section of the
#' `?slopes` documentation for a non-exhaustive list of available
#' arguments.
#' @inheritParams comparisons
#'
#' @details
#' Numerical derivatives for the `slopes` function are calculated
#' using a simple epsilon difference approach: \eqn{\partial Y / \partial X = (f(X + \varepsilon/2) - f(X-\varepsilon/2)) / \varepsilon}{dY/dX = (f(X + e/2) - f(X-e/2)) / e},
#' where f is the `predict()` method associated with the model class, and
#' \eqn{\varepsilon}{e} is determined by the `eps` argument.

# Regression adjustment in experiments

Many analysts who conduct and analyze experiments wish to use regression adjustment with a linear regression model to improve the precision of their estimate of the treatment effect. Unfortunately, regression adjustment can introduce small-sample bias and other undesirable properties (Freedman 2008). Lin (2013) proposes a simple strategy to fix these problems in sufficiently large samples:

1. Center all predictors by subtracting each of their means.
2. Estimate a linear model in which the treatment is interacted with each of the covariates.

The `estimatr` package includes a convenient function to implement this strategy:

```{r}
library(estimatr)
library(marginaleffects)
data("lalonde", package = "MatchIt")

mod <- lm_lin(
    re78 ~ treat,
    covariates = ~ age + educ + race,
    data = lalonde,
    se_type = "HC3")
summary(mod)
```

We can obtain the same results by fitting a model with the standard `lm` function and using the `comparisons()` function:

```{r}
mod <- lm(re78 ~ treat * (age + educ + race), data = lalonde)
comparisons(
    mod,
    variables = "treat",
    vcov = "HC3") |>
    summary()
```

Notice that the `treat` coefficient and associate standard error in the `lm_lin` regression are exactly the same as the estimates produced by the `comparisons()` function.

    abstract = {Psychologists must be able to test both for the presence of an
                effect and for the absence of an effect. In addition to testing
                against zero, researchers can use the two one-sided tests (TOST)
                procedure to test for equivalence and reject the presence of a
                smallest effect size of interest (SESOI). The TOST procedure can
                be used to determine if an observed effect is surprisingly small,
                given that a true effect at least as extreme as the SESOI exists.
                We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in
                psychological science and provide detailed examples of how
                equivalence tests should be performed and reported. Equivalence
                tests are an important extension of the statistical tools
                psychologists currently use and enable researchers to falsify
                predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of
                meaningful effects.},

    abstract = {We study regressions with multiple treatments and a set of
                controls that is flexible enough to purge omitted variable bias.
                We show that these regressions generally fail to estimate convex
                averages of heterogeneous treatment effects—instead, estimates of
                each treatment’s effect are contaminated by non-convex averages
                of the effects of other treatments. We discuss three estimation
                approaches that avoid such contamination bias, including the
                targeting of easiest-to-estimate weighted average effects. A
                re-analysis of nine empirical applications finds economically and
                statistically meaningful contamination bias in observational
                studies; contamination bias in experimental studies is more
                limited due to smaller variability in propensity scores.},

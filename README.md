## Definitions

The `marginaleffects` package allows `R` users to compute and plot four
principal quantities of interest for [71 different classes of
models:](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/supported_models.html)

  - [*Adjusted
    Prediction*](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/predictions.html)
      - The outcome predicted by a fitted model on a specified scale for
        a given combination of values of the predictor variables, such
        as their observed values, their means, or factor levels (a.k.a.
        “reference grid”).
      - [`predictions(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/predictions.html)
        [`plot_cap()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/predictions.html)
  - [*Marginal
    Effect*](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/marginaleffects.html)
      - A partial derivative (slope) of the regression equation with
        respect to a regressor of interest.
      - [`marginaleffects(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/marginaleffects.html)
        [`plot(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/plot.marginaleffects.html)
        [`plot_cme()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/plot_cme.html)
  - [*Contrast*](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/contrasts.html)
      - A difference, ratio, or function of adjusted predictions,
        calculated for meaningfully different predictor values (e.g.,
        College graduates vs. Others).
      - [`comparisons(),`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/comparisons.html)
        [`plot_cco()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/plot_cco.html)
  - [*Marginal
    Mean*](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/marginalmeans.html)
      - Adjusted predictions of a model, averaged across a “reference
        grid” of categorical predictors.
      - [`marginalmeans()`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/marginalmeans.html)

### What does “marginal” mean?

One confusing aspect of the definitions above is that they use the word
“marginal” in two different and *opposite* ways:

1.  In “marginal effects,” we refer to the effect of a tiny (marginal)
    change in the regressor on the outcome. This is a slope, or
    derivative.
2.  In “marginal means,” we refer to the process of marginalizing across
    rows of a prediction grid. This is an average, or integral.

Another potential confusion arises when some analysts use “marginal” to
distinguish some estimates from “conditional” ones. As noted in [the
marginal
effects](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/marginaleffects.html)
and [the
contrasts](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/contrasts.html)
vignettes, slopes and contrasts often vary from individual to
individual, based on the values of all the regressors in the model. When
we estimate a slope or a contrast for a specific combination of
predictors – for one (possibly representative) individual – some people
will call this a “conditional” estimate. When we compute the average of
several individual-level estimates, some people will call this a
“marginal” estimate.

On this website and in this package, we will reserve the expression
“marginal effect” to mean a “slope” or “derivative”. When we take the
average unit-level estimates, we will call this an “average marginal
effect.”

This is all very confusing, but the terminology is so widespread and
inconsistent that we must press on…

## Motivation

To calculate marginal effects (slopes) we need to take derivatives of
the regression equation. To compute standard errors around slopes,
predictions, contrasts, or marginal means, we need to apply the delta
method. These operations can be challenging to do manually, especially
when our models are non-linear, or when regressors are transformed or
interacted. Computing the variance of a marginal effect is even more
difficult.

The `marginaleffects` package hopes to do most of this hard work for
you.

The main packages in the `R` ecosystem to compute marginal effects are
the trailblazing and powerful [`margins` by Thomas J.
Leeper](https://cran.r-project.org/package=margins), and [`emmeans` by
Russell V. Lenth and
contributors.](https://cran.r-project.org/package=emmeans) The
`marginaleffects` package is essentially a clone of `margins`, with some
additional features from `emmeans`.

So why did I write a clone?

  - *Powerful:* Marginal effects and contrasts can be computed for 71
    different classes of models. Adjusted predictions and marginal means
    can be computed for about 100 model types.
  - *Customizable*: Extremely flexible functions to compute custom
    contrasts and transformations.
  - *Extensible:* Adding support for new models is very easy, often
    requiring less than 10 lines of new code. Please submit [feature
    requests on
    Github.](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects/issues)
  - *Fast:* [Computing unit-level standard
    errors](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/performance.html)
    can be orders of magnitude faster than `margins` in large datasets.
  - *Efficient:* Much smaller memory footprint.
  - *Valid:* When possible, numerical results are checked against
    alternative software like `Stata`, or other `R` packages.
  - *Beautiful:* `ggplot2` support for plotting (conditional) marginal
    effects and adjusted predictions.
  - *Tidy:* The results produced by `marginaleffects` follow “tidy”
    principles. They are easy to program with and feed to [other
    packages like
    `modelsummary`.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/)
  - *Simple:* All functions share a simple, unified, and well-documented
    interface.
  - *Thin:* The package requires relatively few dependencies.
  - *Safe:* User input is checked extensively before computation. When
    needed, functions fail gracefully with informative error messages.
  - *Active development*

Downsides of `marginaleffects` include:

  - No multiplicity adjustments. (Use `p.adjust()` instead.)
  - Marginal means are often slower to compute than with `emmeans`.
  - No omnibus test

## Installation

You can install the released version of `marginaleffects` from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("marginaleffects")
```

You can install the development version of `marginaleffects` (and its
dependency `insight`) from R-Universe:

``` r
install.packages(
    c("marginaleffects", "insight"),
    repos = c(
        "https://vincentarelbundock.r-universe.dev",
        "https://easystats.r-universe.dev"))
```

**Restart `R` completely before moving on.**

## Getting started

#### Adjusted predictions

To begin, we estimate a linear regression model with multiplicative
interactions:

``` r
library(marginaleffects)

mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp * wt * am, data = mtcars)
```

An “adjusted prediction” is the outcome predicted by a model for some
combination of the regressors’ values, such as their observed values,
their means, or factor levels (a.k.a. “reference grid”).

By default, the `predictions()` function returns adjusted predictions
for every value in original dataset:

``` r
predictions(mod) |> head()
#>   rowid     type predicted std.error statistic       p.value conf.low conf.high  mpg  hp    wt am
#> 1     1 response  22.48857 0.8841487  25.43528 1.027254e-142 20.66378  24.31336 21.0 110 2.620  1

```

The [`datagrid` function gives us a powerful way to define a grid of
predictors.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/reference/datagrid.html)
All the variables not mentioned explicitly in `datagrid()` are fixed to
their mean or mode:

``` r
predictions(mod, newdata = datagrid(am = 0, wt = seq(2, 3, .2)))
#>   rowid     type predicted std.error statistic       p.value conf.low conf.high      mpg       hp am  wt
#> 1     1 response  21.95621 2.0386301  10.77008  4.765935e-27 17.74868  26.16373 20.09062 146.6875  0 2.0

#> 4     4 response  20.35051 1.2526403  16.24609  2.380723e-59 17.76518  22.93583 20.09062 146.6875  0 2.6
#> 5     5 response  19.81527 1.0144509  19.53301  5.755097e-85 17.72155  21.90900 20.09062 146.6875  0 2.8
#> 6     6 response  19.28004 0.8063905  23.90906 2.465206e-126 17.61573  20.94435 20.09062 146.6875  0 3.0
```

We can plot how predictions change for different values of one or more
variables – Conditional Adjusted Predictions – using the `plot_cap`
function:

``` r
plot_cap(mod, condition = c("hp", "wt"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
plot_cap(mod2, condition = "cyl")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="100%" />

[The Adjusted Predictions
vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/predictions.html)
shows how to use the `predictions()` and `plot_cap()` functions to
compute a wide variety of quantities of interest:

  - Adjusted Predictions at User-Specified Values (aka Predictions at
    Representative Values)
  - Adjusted Predictions at the Mean
  - Average Predictions at the Mean
  - Conditional Predictions
  - Adjusted Predictions on different scales (e.g., link or response)

#### Contrasts

A contrast is the difference between two adjusted predictions,
calculated for meaningfully different predictor values (e.g., College
graduates vs. Others).

What happens to the predicted outcome when a numeric predictor increases
by one unit, and logical variable flips from FALSE to TRUE, and a factor
variable shifts from baseline?

``` r
titanic <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv")
titanic$Woman <- titanic$Sex == "female"
mod3 <- glm(Survived ~ Woman + Age * PClass, data = titanic, family = binomial)

cmp <- comparisons(mod3)
summary(cmp)
#>     Term     Contrast   Effect Std. Error z value   Pr(>|z|)     2.5 %    97.5 %
#> 1  Woman TRUE - FALSE  0.50329   0.031654  15.899 < 2.22e-16  0.441244  0.565327
#> 2    Age           +1 -0.00558   0.001084  -5.147 2.6471e-07 -0.007705 -0.003455
#> 3 PClass    2nd - 1st -0.22603   0.043546  -5.191 2.0950e-07 -0.311383 -0.140686
#> 4 PClass    3rd - 1st -0.38397   0.041845  -9.176 < 2.22e-16 -0.465985 -0.301957
#> 
#> Model type:  glm 
#> Prediction type:  response
```

The contrast above used a simple difference between adjusted
predictions. We can also used different functions to combine and
contrast predictions in different ways. For instance, researchers often
compute Adjusted Risk Ratios, which are ratios of predicted
probabilities. We can compute such ratios by applying a transformation
using the `transform_pre` argument. We can also present the results of
“interactions” between contrasts. What happens to the ratio of
predicted probabilities for survival when `PClass` changes between each
pair of factor levels (“pairwise”) and `Age` changes by 2 standard
deviations simultaneously:

``` r
cmp <- comparisons(
    mod3,
    transform_pre = "ratio",
    variables = list(Age = "2sd", PClass = "pairwise"))
summary(cmp)
#>     Term            Contrast Effect Std. Error z value   Pr(>|z|)  2.5 % 97.5 %
#> 1    Age (x - sd) / (x + sd) 0.6225    0.09166   6.791 1.1126e-11 0.4428 0.8021
#> 2 PClass           2nd / 1st 0.5636    0.05497  10.253 < 2.22e-16 0.4559 0.6713
#> 3 PClass           3rd / 1st 0.3351    0.03932   8.523 < 2.22e-16 0.2580 0.4122
#> 4 PClass           3rd / 2nd 0.6155    0.14373   4.282 1.8484e-05 0.3338 0.8972
#> 
#> Model type:  glm 
#> Prediction type:  response
```

The code above is explained in detail in the [vignette on
Transformations and Custom
Contrasts.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/transformation.html)

[The Contrasts
vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/contrasts.html)
shows how to use the `comparisons()` function to compute a wide variety
of quantities of interest:

  - Custom comparisons for:
      - Numeric variables (e.g., 1 standard deviation, interquartile
        range, custom values)
      - Factor or character
      - Logical
  - Contrast interactions
  - Unit-level Contrasts
  - Average Contrasts
  - Group-Average Contrasts
  - Contrasts at the Mean
  - Contrasts Between Marginal Means
  - Adjusted Risk Ratios

#### Marginal effects

A “marginal effect” is a partial derivative (slope) of the regression
equation with respect to a regressor of interest. It is unit-specific
measure of association between a change in a regressor and a change in
the regressand. The `marginaleffects()` function uses numerical
derivatives to estimate the slope of the regression equation with
respect to each of the variables in the model (or contrasts for
categorical variables).

By default, `marginaleffects()` estimates the slope for each row of the
original dataset that was used to fit the model:

``` r
mfx <- marginaleffects(mod)

head(mfx, 4)
#>   rowid     type term        dydx  std.error statistic     p.value    conf.low     conf.high predicted predicted_hi predicted_lo  mpg  hp    wt am    eps

#> 3     3 response   hp -0.04657166 0.02258715 -2.061866 0.039220507 -0.09084166 -0.0023016728  25.26465     25.26333     25.26465 22.8  93 2.320  1 0.0283

```

The function `summary` calculates the “Average Marginal Effect,” that
is, the average of all unit-specific marginal effects:

``` r
summary(mfx)
#>   Term   Effect Std. Error  z value   Pr(>|z|)    2.5 %   97.5 %
#> 1   hp -0.03807    0.01279 -2.97725 0.00290848 -0.06314 -0.01301
#> 2   wt -3.93909    1.08596 -3.62728 0.00028642 -6.06754 -1.81065
#> 3   am -0.04811    1.85260 -0.02597 0.97928234 -3.67913  3.58292
#> 
#> Model type:  lm 
#> Prediction type:  response
```

The `plot_cme` plots “Conditional Marginal Effects,” that is, the
marginal effects estimated at different values of a regressor (often an
interaction):

``` r
plot_cme(mod, effect = "hp", condition = c("wt", "am"))
```

#### Marginal means

Marginal Means are the adjusted predictions of a model, averaged across
a “reference grid” of categorical predictors. To compute marginal means,
we first need to make sure that the categorical variables of our model
are coded as such in the dataset:

``` r
dat <- mtcars
dat$am <- as.logical(dat$am)
dat$cyl <- as.factor(dat$cyl)
```

Then, we estimate the model and call the `marginalmeans` function:

``` r
mod <- lm(mpg ~ am + cyl + hp, data = dat)
mm <- marginalmeans(mod)
summary(mm)
#>   Term Value  Mean Std. Error z value   Pr(>|z|) 2.5 % 97.5 %
#> 1   am FALSE 18.32     0.7854   23.33 < 2.22e-16 16.78  19.86
#> 2   am  TRUE 22.48     0.8343   26.94 < 2.22e-16 20.84  24.11
#> 3  cyl     4 22.88     1.3566   16.87 < 2.22e-16 20.23  25.54
#> 4  cyl     6 18.96     1.0729   17.67 < 2.22e-16 16.86  21.06
#> 5  cyl     8 19.35     1.3771   14.05 < 2.22e-16 16.65  22.05
#> 
#> Model type:  lm 
#> Prediction type:  response 
#> Results averaged over levels of: am, cyl

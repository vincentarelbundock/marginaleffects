# News

## dev

* `hypotheses()`: The `FUN` argument handles `group` columns gracefully.
* Native support for `Amelia` for multiple imputation.

## 0.15.0

New:

* Conformal prediction via `inferences()`
* `hypothesis` argument now accepts multiple string formulas.
* The `type` argument now accepts an explicit `invlink(link)` value instead of silently back-transforming. Users are no longer pointed to `type_dictionary`. Instead, they should call their function with a bad `type` value, and they will obtain a list of valid types. The default `type` value is printed in the output. This is useful because the default `type` value is `NULL`, so the user often does not explicitly decide.
* Allow install with Rcpp 1.0.0 and greater.

Support new models:

* `survey::svyolr()`

Misc:

* `inferences(method="simulation")` uses the original point estimate rather than the mean of the simulation distribution. Issue #851.
* Better documentation and error messages for `newdata=NULL`
* Some performance improvements for `predictions()` and `marginalmeans()` (#880, #882, @etiennebacher).

Bug fix:

* `newdata="median"` returned mean of binary variables. Thanks to @jkhanson1970 for report #896.

## 0.14.0

Breaking changes:

* Row order of the output changes for some objects. Rows are not sorted alphabetically by `term`, `by`, and variables explicitly supplied to `datagrid`. This can affect hypothesis tests computed using the b1, b2, b3, and other indices.
* New procedure `numderiv` argument use a different procedure to select the step size used in the finite difference numeric derivative used to compute standard errors: abs(x) * sqrt(.Machine$double.eps). The numerical results may not be exactly identical to previous versions of `marginaleffects`, but the step size should be adequate in a broader variety of cases. Note that users can use the `numderiv` argument for more control on numeric differentiation, as documented.
* `bife` models are no longer supported pending investigation in weird results in the tests. Looking for volunteers write more thorough tests.

New:

* Support: `logistf` package.
* Support: `DCchoice` package.
* Support: `stats::nls`
* `hypotheses()` can now accept raw data frame, which gives a lot of flexibility for custom contrasts and functions. See the Hypothesis vignette for an example.
* `numderiv` argument allows users to use finite difference (center or forward) or Richardson's method to compute the numerical derivatives used in the calculation of standard errors.

Bug fixes:

* `inferences()` supports the `cross` argument for `comparisons()` objects. Thanks to Kirill Solovev for report #856.
* `splines::bs()` in formulas could produce incorrect results due to weirdness in `stats::model.matrix()`. Thanks to @chiungming for report #831.
* `mgcv` with `ocat` are now supported. Thanks to Lorenzo Fabbri for Issue #844.
* `quantreg` problem with `rowid` merge did not affect estimates but did not return the full original data. Issue #829.
* `get_modeldata()` extracts weights variable when available.
* `predictions()` is no longer broken in some `inferences()` calls. Issue #853
* Inaccurate averaging with `comparison=differenceavg` some models where all predictors are categorical. Thanks to Karl Ove Hufthammer for report #865.

Misc:

* Major refactor to simplify the code base and make maintenance easier.

## marginaleffects 0.13.0

Breaking change:

* `glmmTMB`: Standard errors are no longer supported because they may have been erroneous. Follow Issue #810 on Github for developments: https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects/issues/810

New:

* `hypothesis` argument accepts wildcards: `hypothesis = "b*=b1"`
* `s.value` column in all output: Shannon transforms for p values. See Greenland (2019).
* `marginal_means` supports `mira` (`mice` objects).
* `comparisons()`: The `variables` arguments now accepts arbitrary numeric vectors of length equal to the number of rows in `newdata`. This allows users to specify fully custom treatment sizes. In the documentation examples, we show how to estimate the difference for a 1 standard deviation shift in a regressor, where the standard deviation is calculated on a group-wise basis.
* `comparisons()`: the `variables` argument now accepts "revpairwise", "revsequential", "revreference" for factor and character variables.
* `comparisons()`: the `comparison` argument now accept "lift" and "liftavg".

Performance:

* Computing elasticities for linear models is now up to 30% faster (#787, @etiennebacher).

Bug fixes:

* Better handling of environments when `newdata` is a function call. Thanks to @jcccf for report #814 and to @capnrefsmmat for the proposed fix using the `rlang` package.
* Degrees of freedom mismatch for joint hypothesis tests. Thanks to @snhansen for report #789.

## marginaleffects 0.12.0

Breaking change:

* Row order of output has changed for many calls, especially those using the `by` argument. This may break hypothesis tests conducted by indexing `b1`, `b2`, etc. This was necessary to fix Issue #776. Thanks to @marcora for the report.

New:

* `hypotheses()`: Joint hypothesis tests (F and Chi-square) with the `joint` and `joint_test` arguments.
* `vcov.hypotheses` method.
* `wts` is now available in `plot_predictions()`, `plot_comparisons()`, and `plot_slopes()`.

Bug:

* Wrong order of rows in bayesian models with `by` argument. Thanks to @shirdekel for report #782.

## marginaleffects 0.11.2

* `vcov()` and `coef()` methods for `marginaleffects` objects.
* Strings in `wts` are accepted with the `by` argument.
* `predictions()` and `avg_predictions()` no longer use an automatic backtransformation for GLM models unless `hypothesis` is `NULL`.
* `vcov()` can be used to retrieve a full variance-covariance matrix from objects produced by `comparisons()`, `slopes()`, `predictions()`, or `marginal_means()` objects.
* When processing objects obtained using `mice` multiple imputation, the pooled model using `mice::pool` is attached to the `model` attribute of the output. This means that functions like `modelsummary::modelsummary()` will not erroneously report goodness-of-fit statistics from just a single model and will instead appropriately report the statistics for the pooled model. Thanks to @Tristan-Siegfried for PR #740.
* More informative error messages on some prediction problems. Thanks to @andymilne for Report #751.

Performance:

* `inferences()` is now up to 17x faster and much more memory-efficient when `method` is `"boot"` or `"rsample"` (#770, #771, @etiennebacher).

Bugs:

* `brms` models with `nl=TRUE` and a single predictor generated an error. Thanks to @Tristan-Siegried for Report #759.
* `avg_predictions()`: Incorrect group-wise averaging when all predictors are categorical, the `variables` variable is used, and  we are averaging with `avg_` or the `by` argument. Thanks to BorgeJorge for report #766.
* Bug when `datagrid()` when called inside a user-written function. Thanks to @NickCH-K for report #769 and to @capnrefsmmat for the diagnostics.


## marginaleffects 0.11.1

Breaking change:

* Row orders are now more consistent, but may have changed from previous version. This could affect results from `hypothesis` with `b1`, `b2`, ... indexing.

Support new models:

* `nlme::lme()`
* `phylolm::phylolm()`
* `phylolm::phyloglm()`

New:

* Vignette on 2x2 experimental designs. Thanks to Demetri Pananos.
* `comparisons()` accepts data frames with two numeric columns ("low" and "high") to specify fully customizable contrasts.
* `datagrid()` gets a new `by` argument to create apply grid-making functions within groups.
* `plot_*()` gain a `newdata` argument for use with `by`.

Bug:

* `comparisons(comparison = "lnratioavg")` ignored `wts` argument. Thanks to Demetri Pananos for report #737.
* `ordinal::clm()`: incorrect standard errors when location and scale parameters are the same. Thanks to MrJerryTAO for report #718.
* Incorrect label for "2sd" comparisons. Thanks to Andy Milne for report #720.
* Invalid factor levels in `datagrid()` means `newdata` argument gets ignored. Thanks to Josh Errickson for report #721.
* Error in models with only categorical predictors and the `by` argument. Thanks to Sam Brilleman for report #723.
* Elasticities are now supported for `ordinal::clm()` models. Thanks to MrJerryTAO for report #729.
* `glmmTMB` models with zero-inflated components are supported. Thanks to @Helsinki-Ronan and @strengejacke for report #734.

## marginaleffects 0.11.0

Breaking changes:

* `type` column is replaced by `type` attribute.
* `predictions()` only works with officially supported model types (same list as `comparisons()` and `slopes()`).

Renamed arguments (backward compatibility is preserved):

* `transform_pre` -> `comparison`
* `transform_post` -> `transform`

New:

* `p_adjust` argument: Adjust p-values for multiple comparisons. 
* `equivalence` argument available everywhere.

Performance:

* Much faster results in `avg_*()` functions for models with only categorical predictors and many rows of data, using deduplication and weights instead of unit-level estimates.
* Faster predictions in `lm()` and `glm()` models using `RcppEigen`.
* Bayesian models with many rows. Thanks to Etienne Bacher. #694 
* Faster predictions, especially with standard errors and large datasets.

Bugs:

* Multiple imputation with `mira` objects was not pooling all datasets. Thanks to  @Generalized for report #711.
* Support for more models with offsets. Thanks to @mariofiorini for report #705.
* Error on `predictions()` with `by` and `wts`. Thanks to Noah Greifer for report #695.
* `afex`: some models generated errors. Thanks to  Daniel Lüdecke for report #696.
* `group` column name is always forbidden. Thanks to Daniel Lüdecke for report #697.
* Blank graphs in `plot_comparisons()` with a list in `variables`.
* `type="link"` produced an error with some categorical `brms` models. Thanks to @shirdekel for report #703.
* Error on `predictions(variables = ...)` for `glmmTMB` models. Thanks to Daniel Lüdecke for report #707.
* `by` with user-specified function in `comparison` and factor predictor did not aggregate correctly. Thanks to @joaotedde for report #715.
* `ordinal::clm`: Support `cum.prob` and `linear.predictor` prediction types. Thanks to @MrJerryTAO for report #717.

## marginaleffects 0.10.0

Performance:

* 2-4x faster execution for many calls. Thanks to Etienne Bacher.

New models supported:

* `MCMCglmm::MCMCglmm`
* `Rchoice::hetprob`
* `Rchoice::ivpml`
* Multiple imputation using `mice` and any package which can return a list of imputed data frames (e.g., `Amelia`, `missRanger`, etc.)

Plot improvements:

* New `by` argument to display marginal estimates by subgroup.
* New `rug` argument to display tick marks in the margins.
* New `points` argument in `plot_predictions()` to display a scatter plot.
* New `gray` argument to plot in grayscale using line types and shapes instead of color.
* The `effect` argument is renamed to `variables` in `plot_slopes()` and `plot_comparisons()`. This improves consistency with the analogous `slopes()` and `comparisons()` functions.
* The plotting vignette was re-written.

Other:

* Support multiple imputation with `mice` `mira` objects. The multiple imputation vignette was rewritten.
* The `variables_grid` argument in `marginal_means()` is renamed `newdata`. Backward compatibility is maintained.
* `avg_*()` returns an informative error when `vcov` is "satterthwaite" or "kenward-roger"
* "satterthwaite" and "kenward-roger" are now supported when `newdata` is not `NULL`
* Informative error when `hypothesis` includes a `b#` larger than the available number of estimates.
* `avg_predictions(model, variables = "x")` computes average counterfactual predictions by subgroups of `x`
* `datagrid()` and `plot_*()` functions are faster in datasets with many extraneous columns.
* In `predictions(type = NULL)` with `glm()` and `Gam()` we first make predictions on the link scale and then backtransform them. Setting `type="response"` explicitly makes predictions directly on the response scale without backtransformation.
* Standard errors now supported for more `glmmTMB` models.
* Use the `numDeriv` package for numeric differentiation in the calculation of delta method standard error. A global option can now be passed to `numDeriv::jacobian`:
  - `options(marginaleffects_numDeriv = list(method = "simple", method.args = list(eps = 1e-6)))`
  - `options(marginaleffects_numDeriv = list(method = "Richardson", method.args = list(eps = 1e-6)))`
  - `options(marginaleffects_numDeriv = NULL)`
* Print:
  - Print fewer significant digits.
  - `print.marginaleffects` now prints all columns supplied to `newdata`
  - Less redundant labels when using `hypothesis`
* Many improvements to documentation.

Bugfixes:

* Standard errors could be inaccurate in models with non-linear components (and interactions) when some of the coefficients were very small. This was related to the step size used for numerical differentiation for the delta method. Issue #684.
* `avg_predictions(by =)` did not work when the dataset included a column named `term`. Issue #683.
* `brms` models with multivariate outcome collapsed categories in `comparisons()`. Issue #639.
* `hypotheses()` now works on lists and in calls to `lapply()`, `purrr::map()`, etc. Issue #660.

## marginaleffects 0.9.0

Breaking changes:

* All functions return an `estimate` column instead of the function-specific `predicted`, `comparisons`, `dydx`, etc. This change only affects unit-level estimates, and not average estimates, which already used the `estimate` column name.
* The `transform_avg` argument in `tidy()` deprecated. Use `transform_post` instead.
* `plot_*(draw=FALSE)` now return the actual variable names supplied to the `condition` argument, rather than the opaque "condition1", "condition2", etc.

New models supported:

* `blme` package.

New features:

* New functions: `avg_predictions()`, `avg_comparisons()`, `avg_slopes()`
* Equivalence, non-inferiority, and non-superiority tests with the `hypotheses()` function and `equivalence` argument.
* New experimental `inferences()` function: simulation-based inferences and bootstrap using the `boot`, `rsample`, and `fwb` package.
* New `df` argument to set degrees of freedom manually for p and CI.
* Pretty `print()` for all objects.
* `by` argument
  - `TRUE` returns average (marginal) predictions, comparisons, or slopes.
  - Supports bayesian models.
* `hypothesis` argument
  - Numeric value sets the null used in calculating Z and p.
  - Example: `comparisons(mod, transform_pre = "ratio", hypothesis = 1)`
* All arguments from the main functions are now available through `tidy()`, and `summary()`: `conf_level`, `transform_post`, etc.
* Bayesian posterior distribution summaries (median, mean, HDI, quantiles) can be customized using global options. See `?comparisons`

Renamed functions (backward-compatibility is maintained by keeping the old function names as aliases):

* `marginaleffects()` -> `slopes()` 
* `posteriordraws()` -> `posterior_draws()` 
* `marginalmeans()` -> `marginal_means()` 
* `plot_cap()` -> `plot_predictions()`
* `plot_cme()` -> `plot_slopes()`
* `plot_cco()` -> `plot_comparisons()`

Bug fixes:

* Incorrect results: In 0.8.1, `plot_*()` the `threenum` and `minmax` labels did not correspond to the correct numeric values.
* Fix corner case for slopes when the dataset includes infinite values.
* `mlogit` error with factors.
* The `vcov` argument now accepts functions for most models.

Other:

* Removed major performance bottleneck for `slopes()`

## marginaleffects 0.8.1

* `deltamethod()` can run hypothesis tests on objects produced by the `comparisons()`, `marginaleffects()`, `predictions()`, and `marginalmeans()` functions. This feature relies on `match.call()`, which means it may not always work when used programmatically, inside functions and nested environments. It is generally safer and more efficient to use the `hypothesis` argument.
* `plot_cme()` and `plot_cco()` accept lists with user-specified values for the regressors, and can display nice labels for shortcut string-functions like "threenum" or "quartile".
* `posterior_draws`: new `shape` argument to return MCMC draws in various formats, including the new `rvar` structure from the `posterior` package.
* `transform_avg` function gets printed in `summary()` output.
* `transform_post` and `transform_avg` support string shortcuts: "exp" and "ln"
* Added support for `mlm` models from `lm()`. Thanks to Noah Greifer.

Bug fixes:

* `hypothesis` argument with bayesian models and `tidy()` used to raise an error.
* Missing values for some regressors in the `comparisons()` output for `brms` models.

## marginaleffects 0.8.0

Breaking change:

* The `interaction` argument is deprecated and replaced by the `cross` argument. This is to reduce ambiguity with respect to the `interaction` argument in `emmeans`, which does something completely different, akin to the difference-in-differences illustrated in the Interactions vignette.

71 classes of models supported, including the new:

* `rms::ols`
* `rms::lrm`
* `rms::orm`

New features:

* Plots: `plot_cme()`, `plot_cap()`, and `plot_cco()` are now much more flexible in specifying the comparisons to display. The `condition` argument accepts lists, functions, and shortcuts for common reference values, such as "minmax", "threenum", etc.
* `variables` argument of the `comparisons()` function is more flexible:
  - Accepts functions to specify custom differences in numeric variables (e.g., forward and backward differencing).
  - Can specify pairs of factors to compare in the `variables` argument of the `comparisons` function.
* `variables` argument of the `predictions()` function is more flexible:
  - Accepts shortcut strings, functions, and vectors of arbitrary length.
* Integrate out random effects in bayesian `brms` models (see Bayesian analysis vignette)

New vignettes:

* Experiments
* Extending marginal effects
* Integrating out random effects in bayesian models

Bug fixes and minor improvements:

* The default value of `conf_level` in `summary()` and `tidy()` is now `NULL`, which inherits the `conf_level` value in the original `comparisons`/`marginaleffects`/`predictions` calls.
* Fix typo in function names for missing "lnratioavgwts"
* Interactions with `fixest::i()` are parsed properly as categorical variables
* For `betareg` objects, inference can now be done on all coefficients using `deltamethod()`. previously only the location coefficients were available.
* For objects from `crch` package, a number of bugs have been fixed; standard errors should now be correct for `deltamethod()`, `marginaleffects()`, etc.
* Fixed a bug in the `tidy()` function for `glmmTMB` models without random effects, which caused all t statistics to be identical.

## marginaleffects 0.7.1

* New supported model class: `gamlss`. Thanks to Marcio Augusto Diniz.
* `marginalmeans()` accepts a `wts` argument with values: "equal", "proportional", "cells".
* `by` argument 
  - accepts data frames for complex groupings.
  - in `marginalmeans` only accepts data frames.
  - accepts "group" to group by response level.
  - works with bayesian models.
* `byfun` argument for the `predictions()` function to aggregate using different functions.
* `hypothesis` argument
  - The matrix column names are used as labels for hypothesis tests.
  - Better labels with "sequential", "reference", "pairwise".
  - new shortcuts "revpairwise", "revsequential", "revreference"
* `wts` argument is respected in `by` argument and with `*avg` shortcuts in the `transform_pre` argument.
* `tidy.predictions()` and `tidy.marginalmeans()` get a new `transform_avg` argument.
* New vignettes: 
  - Unit-level contrasts in logistic regressions. Thanks to @arthur-albuquerque.
  - Python Numpy models in `marginaleffects`. Thanks to @timpipeseek.
  - Bootstrap example in standard errors vignette.

## marginaleffects 0.7.0

Breaking changes:

* `by` is deprecated in `summary()` and `tidy()`. Use the same `by` argument in the main functions instead: `comparisons()`, `marginaleffects()`, `predictions()`
* Character vectors are no longer supported in the `variables` argument of the `predictions()` function. Use `newdata="fivenum"` or "grid", "mean", or "median" instead.

Critical bug fix:

* Contrasts with interactions were incorrect in version 0.6.0. The error should have been obvious to most analysts in most cases (weird-looking alignment). Thanks to @vmikk. 

New supported packages and models:

* `survival::clogit`
* `biglm`: The main quantities can be computed, but not the delta method standard errors. See https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects/issues/387

New vignette:

* Elasticity
* Frequently Asked Questions

New features:

* Elasticity and semi-elasticity using the new `slope` argument in `marginaleffects()`: eyex, dyex, eydx
* `datagrid()` accepts functions: `datagrid(newdata = mtcars, hp = range, mpg = fivenum, wt = sd)`
* New `datagridcf()` function to create counterfactual datasets. This is a shortcut to the `datagrid()` function with default to `grid_type = "counterfactual"`
* New `by` arguments in `predictions()`, `comparisons()`, `marginaleffects()`
* New `newdata` shortcuts: "tukey", "grid"
* New string shortcuts for `transform_pre` in `comparisons()`
* `marginalmeans()` now back transforms confidence intervals when possible.
* `vcov` argument string shortcuts are now case-insensitive
* The default contrast in `comparisons()` for binary predictors is now a difference between 1 and 0, rather than +1 relative to baseline.
* documentation improvements

## marginaleffects 0.6.0

New supported packages and models:

* `tidymodels` objects of class `tidy_model` are supported if the fit engine is supported by `marginaleffects`.

* `plot_cco()`: Plot conditional contrasts

New arguments:

* Causal Inference with the g-Formula: https://marginaleffects.com/articles/gformula.html
 (Thanks to Rohan Kapre for the idea)

Deprecated or renamed arguments:

* `contrast_factor` and `contrast_numeric` arguments are deprecated in `comparisons()`. Use a named list in the `variables` argument instead. Backward compatibility is maintained.
* The `transform_post` argument in `tidy()` and `summary()` is renamed to `transform_avg` to disambiguate against the argument of the same name in `comparisons()`. Backward compatibility is preserved.

Misc:

* `tidy.predictions()` computes standard errors using the delta method for average predictions
* Support `gam` models with matrix columns.
* `eps` in `marginaleffects()` is now "adaptive" by default: it equals 0.0001 multiplied the range of the predictor variable
* `comparisons()` now supports "log of marginal odds ratio" in the `transform_pre` argument. Thanks to Noah Greifer.
* New `transform_pre` shortcuts: dydx, expdydx
* `tidy.predictions()` computes standard errors and confidence intervals for linear models or GLM on the link scale.

## marginaleffects 0.5.0

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p> <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p> <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p> <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p> <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p> <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p> <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p> <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p> <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>"},{"location":"LICENSE/#terms-and-conditions","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS","text":""},{"location":"LICENSE/#0-definitions","title":"0.

When <code>eps</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the step size is 0.0001 multiplied by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the variable with respect to which we are taking the derivative. Changing <code>eps</code> may be necessary to avoid numerical problems in certain models.  <code>numderiv</code>   string or list of strings indicating the method to use to for the numeric differentiation used in to compute delta method standard errors.  <ul> <li>  \"fdforward\": finite difference method with forward differences  </li> <li>  \"fdcenter\": finite difference method with central differences (default)  </li> <li>  \"richardson\": Richardson extrapolation method  </li> <li>  Extra arguments can be specified by passing a list to the <code>numDeriv</code> argument, with the name of the method first and named arguments following, ex: <code>numderiv=list(\u201cfdcenter\u201d, eps = 1e-5)</code>.

Confidence level to use to build a confidence interval.  <code>type</code>  string indicates the type (scale) of the predictions used to compute marginal effects or contrasts. This can differ based on the model type, but will typically be a string such as: \"response\", \"link\", \"probs\", or \"zero\". When an unsupported string is entered, the model-specific list of acceptable values is returned in an error message. When <code>type</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the first entry in the error message is used by default.  <code>transform</code>  A function applied to unit-level adjusted predictions and confidence intervals just before the function returns results. For bayesian models, this function is applied to individual draws from the posterior distribution, before computing summaries.  <code>cross</code>   TRUE or FALSE  <ul> <li> <code>FALSE</code> (default): Marginal means are computed for each predictor individually.  </li> <li> <code>TRUE</code>: Marginal means are computed for each combination of predictors specified in the <code>variables</code> argument.  </li> </ul> <code>hypothesis</code>   specify a hypothesis test or custom contrast using a numeric value, vector, or matrix, a string, or a string formula.  <ul> <li>  Numeric:  <ul> <li>  Single value: the null hypothesis used in the computation of Z and p (before applying <code>transform</code>).  </li> <li>  Vector: Weights to compute a linear combination of (custom contrast between) estimates. Length equal to the number of rows generated by the same function call, but without the <code>hypothesis</code> argument.  </li> <li>  Matrix: Each column is a vector of weights, as describe above, used to compute a distinct linear combination of (contrast between) estimates.

The <code>\u2060b\\*\u2060</code> wildcard can be used to test hypotheses on all estimates. Examples:  <ul> <li> <code>hp = drat</code> </li> <li> <code>hp + drat = 12</code> </li> <li> <code>b1 + b2 + b3 = 0</code> </li> <li> <code>\u2060b\\* / b1 = 1\u2060</code> </li> </ul> </li> <li>  String:  <ul> <li>  \"pairwise\": pairwise differences between estimates in each row.  </li> <li>  \"reference\": differences between the estimates in each row and the estimate in the first row.  </li> <li>  \"sequential\": difference between an estimate and the estimate in the next row.  </li> <li>  \"revpairwise\", \"revreference\", \"revsequential\": inverse of the corresponding hypotheses, as described above.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>  See the Examples section below and the vignette: https://marginaleffects.com/articles/hypothesis.html  </li> </ul> <code>equivalence</code>  Numeric vector of length 2: bounds used for the two-one-sided test (TOST) of equivalence, and for the non-inferiority and non-superiority tests.

See stats::p.adjust  <code>df</code>  Degrees of freedom used to compute p values and confidence intervals. A single numeric value between 1 and <code>Inf</code>. When <code>df</code> is <code>Inf</code>, the normal distribution is used. When <code>df</code> is finite, the <code>t</code> distribution is used. See insight::get_df for a convenient function to extract degrees of freedom. Ex: <code>slopes(model, df = insight::get_df(model))</code> <code>wts</code>   character value.

Confidence level to use to build a confidence interval.  <code>type</code>  string indicates the type (scale) of the predictions used to compute contrasts or slopes. This can differ based on the model type, but will typically be a string such as: \"response\", \"link\", \"probs\", or \"zero\". When an unsupported string is entered, the model-specific list of acceptable values is returned in an error message. When <code>type</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the first entry in the error message is used by default.  <code>by</code>   Aggregate unit-level estimates (aka, marginalize, average over). Valid inputs:  <ul> <li> <code>FALSE</code>: return the original unit-level estimates.  </li> <li> <code>TRUE</code>: aggregate estimates for each term.  </li> <li>  Character vector of column names in <code>newdata</code> or in the data frame produced by calling the function without the <code>by</code> argument.  </li> <li>  Data frame with a <code>by</code> column of group labels, and merging columns shared by <code>newdata</code> or the data frame produced by calling the same function without the <code>by</code> argument.  </li> <li>  See examples below.  </li> <li>  For more complex aggregations, you can use the <code>FUN</code> argument of the <code>hypotheses()</code> function.

Must accept a numeric vector and return a single numeric value. This is sometimes used to take the sum or mean of predicted probabilities across outcome or predictor levels. See examples section.  <code>wts</code>   string or numeric: weights to use when computing average contrasts or slopes. These weights only affect the averaging in <code>\u2060avg\\_\\*()\u2060</code> or with the <code>by</code> argument, and not the unit-level estimates themselves. Internally, estimates and weights are passed to the <code>weighted.mean()</code> function.  <ul> <li>  string: column name of the weights variable in <code>newdata</code>. When supplying a column name to <code>wts</code>, it is recommended to supply the original data (including the weights variable) explicitly to <code>newdata</code>.  </li> <li>  numeric: vector of length equal to the number of rows in the original data or in <code>newdata</code> (if supplied).  </li> </ul> <code>transform</code>  A function applied to unit-level adjusted predictions and confidence intervals just before the function returns results. For bayesian models, this function is applied to individual draws from the posterior distribution, before computing summaries.  <code>hypothesis</code>   specify a hypothesis test or custom contrast using a numeric value, vector, or matrix, a string, or a string formula.  <ul> <li>  Numeric:  <ul> <li>  Single value: the null hypothesis used in the computation of Z and p (before applying <code>transform</code>).  </li> <li>  Vector: Weights to compute a linear combination of (custom contrast between) estimates. Length equal to the number of rows generated by the same function call, but without the <code>hypothesis</code> argument.  </li> <li>  Matrix: Each column is a vector of weights, as describe above, used to compute a distinct linear combination of (contrast between) estimates. The column names of the matrix are used as labels in the output.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>  String formula to specify linear or non-linear hypothesis tests. If the <code>term</code> column uniquely identifies rows, terms can be used in the formula. Otherwise, use <code>b1</code>, <code>b2</code>, etc. to identify the position of each parameter. The <code>\u2060b\\*\u2060</code> wildcard can be used to test hypotheses on all estimates. Examples:  <ul> <li> <code>hp = drat</code> </li> <li> <code>hp + drat = 12</code> </li> <li> <code>b1 + b2 + b3 = 0</code> </li> <li> <code>\u2060b\\* / b1 = 1\u2060</code> </li> </ul> </li> <li>  String:  <ul> <li>  \"pairwise\": pairwise differences between estimates in each row.  </li> <li>  \"reference\": differences between the estimates in each row and the estimate in the first row.  </li> <li>  \"sequential\": difference between an estimate and the estimate in the next row.  </li> <li>  \"revpairwise\", \"revreference\", \"revsequential\": inverse of the corresponding hypotheses, as described above.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>  See the Examples section below and the vignette: https://marginaleffects.com/articles/hypothesis.html  </li> </ul> <code>equivalence</code>  Numeric vector of length 2: bounds used for the two-one-sided test (TOST) of equivalence, and for the non-inferiority and non-superiority tests.

See stats::p.adjust  <code>df</code>  Degrees of freedom used to compute p values and confidence intervals. A single numeric value between 1 and <code>Inf</code>. When <code>df</code> is <code>Inf</code>, the normal distribution is used. When <code>df</code> is finite, the <code>t</code> distribution is used. See insight::get_df for a convenient function to extract degrees of freedom. Ex: <code>slopes(model, df = insight::get_df(model))</code> <code>numderiv</code>   string or list of strings indicating the method to use to for the numeric differentiation used in to compute delta method standard errors.  <ul> <li>  \"fdforward\": finite difference method with forward differences  </li> <li>  \"fdcenter\": finite difference method with central differences (default)  </li> <li>  \"richardson\": Richardson extrapolation method  </li> <li>  Extra arguments can be specified by passing a list to the <code>numDeriv</code> argument, with the name of the method first and named arguments following, ex: <code>numderiv=list(\u201cfdcenter\u201d, eps = 1e-5)</code>.

Lenth and colleagues. <code>emmeans</code> is a truly incredible piece of software, and a trailblazer in the <code>R</code> ecosystem. It is an extremely powerful package whose functionality overlaps <code>marginaleffects</code> to a significant degree: marginal means, contrasts, and slopes. Even if the two packages can compute many of the same quantities, <code>emmeans</code> and <code>marginaleffects</code> have pretty different philosophies with respect to user interface and computation.</p> <p>An <code>emmeans</code> analysis typically starts by computing \u201cmarginal means\u201d by holding all numeric covariates at their means, and by averaging across a balanced grid of categorical predictors. Then, users can use the <code>contrast()</code> function to estimate the difference between marginal means.</p> <p>The <code>marginaleffects</code> package supplies a <code>marginal_means</code> function which can replicate most <code>emmeans</code> analyses by computing marginal means. However, the typical analysis is more squarely centered on predicted/fitted values. This is a useful starting point because, in many cases, analysts will find it easy and intuitive to express their scientific queries in terms of changes in predicted values. For example,</p> <ul> <li>How does the average predicted probability of survival differ     between treatment and control group?</li> <li>What is the difference between the predicted wage of college and     high school graduates?</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s say we estimate a linear regression model with two continuous regressors and a multiplicative interaction:</p> <p>y\u2004=\u2004\u03b20\u2005+\u2005\u03b21x\u2005+\u2005\u03b22z\u2005+\u2005\u03b23x\u2005\u22c5\u2005z\u2005+\u2005\u03b5</p> <p>In this model, the effect of x on y will depend on the value of covariate z. Let\u2019s say the user wants to estimate what happens to the predicted value of y when x increases by 1 unit, when z\u2004\u2208\u2004{\u2005\u2212\u20051,\u20060,\u20061}. To do this, we use the <code>comparisons()</code> function. The <code>variables</code> argument determines the scientific query of interest, and the <code>newdata</code> argument determines the grid of covariate values on which we want to evaluate the query:</p> <pre><code>model &lt;- lm(y ~ x * z, data)\ncomparisons(\nmodel,\nvariables = list(x = 1), # what is the effect of 1-unit change in x?\nnewdata = datagrid(z = -1:1) # when z is held at values -1, 0, or 1\n)\n</code></pre> <p>As the vignettes show, <code>marginaleffects</code> can also compute contrasts on marginal means. It can also compute various quantities of interest like raw fitted values, slopes (partial derivatives), and contrasts between marginal means. It also offers a flexible mechanism to run (non-)linear hypothesis tests using the delta method, and it offers fully customizable strategy to compute quantities like odds ratios (or completely arbitrary functions of predicted outcome).</p> <p>Thus, in my (Vincent\u2019s) biased opinion, the main benefits of <code>marginaleffects</code> over <code>emmeans</code> are:</p> <ul> <li>Support more model types.</li> <li>Simpler, more intuitive, and highly consistent user interface.</li> <li>Easier to compute average slopes or unit-level contrasts for whole     datasets.</li> <li>Easier to compute slopes (aka marginal effects, trends, or partial     derivatives) for custom grids and continuous regressors.</li> <li>Easier to implement causal inference strategies like the parametric     g-formula and regression adjustment in experiments (see vignettes).</li> <li>Allows the computation of arbitrary quantities of interest via     user-supplied functions and automatic delta method inference.</li> <li>Common plots are easy with the <code>plot_predictions()</code>,     <code>plot_comparisons()</code>, and <code>plot_slopes()</code> functions.</li> </ul> <p>To be fair, many of the <code>marginaleffects</code> advantages listed above come down to subjective preferences over user interface. Readers are thus encouraged to try both packages to see which interface they prefer.</p> <p>The main advantages of <code>emmeans</code> over <code>marginaleffects</code> arise when users are specifically interested in marginal means, where <code>emmeans</code> tends to be much faster and to have a lot of functionality to handle backtransformations. <code>emmeans</code> also has better functionality for effect sizes; notably, the <code>eff_size()</code> function can return effect size estimates that account for uncertainty in both estimated effects and the population SD.</p> <p>Please let me know if you find other features in <code>emmeans</code> so I can add them to this list.</p> <p>The Marginal Means Vignette includes side-by-side comparisons of <code>emmeans</code> and <code>marginaleffects</code> to compute marginal means. The rest of this section compares the syntax for contrasts and marginaleffects.</p>"},{"location":"vignettes/alternative_software/#contrasts","title":"Contrasts","text":"<p>As far as I can tell, <code>emmeans</code> does not provide an easy way to compute unit-level contrasts for every row of the dataset used to fit our model.

Roughly speaking:</p> <ol> <li>Create a prediction grid with one cell for each combination of     categorical predictors in the model, and all numeric variables held     at their means.</li> <li>Make adjusted predictions in each cell of the prediction grid.</li> <li>Take the average of those predictions (marginal means) for each     combination of <code>btype</code> (focal variable) and <code>resp</code> (group <code>by</code>     variable).</li> <li>Compute pairwise differences (contrasts) in marginal means across     different levels of the focal variable <code>btype</code>.</li> </ol> <p>In short, <code>emmeans</code> computes pairwise contrasts between marginal means, which are themselves averages of adjusted predictions. This is different from the default types of contrasts produced by <code>comparisons()</code>, which reports contrasts between adjusted predictions, without averaging across a pre-specified grid of predictors. What does <code>comparisons()</code> do instead?</p> <p>Let <code>newdata</code> be a data frame supplied by the user (or the original data frame used to fit the model), then:</p> <ol> <li>Create a new data frame called <code>newdata2</code>, which is identical to     <code>newdata</code> except that the focal variable is incremented by one     level.</li> <li>Compute contrasts as the difference between adjusted predictions     made on the two datasets:<ul> <li><code>predict(model, newdata = newdata2) - predict(model, newdata = newdata)</code></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Although it is not idiomatic, we can use still use <code>comparisons()</code> to emulate the <code>emmeans</code> results. First, we create a prediction grid with one cell for each combination of categorical predictor in the model:</p> <pre><code>nd &lt;- datagrid(\nmodel = mod,\nresp = dat$resp,\nsitu = dat$situ,\nbtype = dat$btype)\nnrow(nd)\n#&gt; [1] 18\n</code></pre> <p>This grid has 18 rows, one for each combination of levels for the <code>resp</code> (3), <code>situ</code> (2), and <code>btype</code> (3) variables (3 * 2 * 3 = 18).</p> <p>Then we compute pairwise contrasts over this grid:</p> <pre><code>cmp &lt;- comparisons(mod,\nvariables = list(\"btype\" = \"pairwise\"),\nnewdata = nd,\ntype = \"link\")\nnrow(cmp)\n#&gt; [1] 54\n</code></pre> <p>There are 3 pairwise contrasts, corresponding to the 3 pairwise comparisons possible between the 3 levels of the focal variable <code>btype</code>: <code>scold-curse</code>, <code>shout-scold</code>, <code>shout-curse</code>. The <code>comparisons()</code> function estimates those 3 contrasts for each row of <code>newdata</code>, so we get 18\u2005\u00d7\u20053\u2004=\u200454 rows.</p> <p>Finally, if we wanted contrasts averaged over each subgroup of the <code>resp</code> variable, we can use the <code>avg_comparisons()</code> function with the <code>by</code> argument:</p> <pre><code>avg_comparisons(mod,\nby = \"resp\",\nvariables = list(\"btype\" = \"pairwise\"),\nnewdata = nd,\ntype = \"link\")\n#&gt; \n#&gt;   Term                  Contrast    resp Estimate Std.

For example, the <code>adjrr</code> function the <code>Stata</code> software package can compute \u201cadjusted risk ratios\u201d, which are ratios of adjusted predictions. To do this in <code>R</code>, we use the <code>comparison</code> argument:</p> <pre><code>avg_comparisons(mod, comparison = \"ratio\")\n#&gt; \n#&gt;  Term Contrast Estimate Std.

These strings are shortcuts for functions that accept two vectors of adjusted predictions and returns a single vector of contrasts.

It relies on the same identification assumptions as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW), but uses different modeling assumptions. Whereas IPW models the treatment equation, standardization models the mean outcome equation. As Hern\u00e1n and Robins note:</p> <p>\u201cBoth IP weighting and standardization are estimators of the g-formula, a general method for causal inference first described in 1986. \u2026 We say that standardization is a\u201dplug-in g-formula estimator\u201d because it simply replaces the conditional mean outcome in the g-formula by its estimates. When, like in Chapter 13, those estimates come from parametric models, we refer to the method as the parametric g-formula.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"vignettes/gcomputation/#how-does-it-work","title":"How does it work?","text":"<p>Imagine a causal model like this:</p> <p></p> <p>We want to estimate the effect of a binary treatment X on outcome Y, but there is a confounding variable W.

It essentially involves re-weighting your sample so that it represents the population you\u2019re interested in. Typically, we begin by estimating the predicted probability that each unit is treated. Then, we use these probabilities as weights in model fitting and in the computation of marginal effects, contrasts, risk differences, ratios, etc.</p> <p>This chapter introduces how to use <code>marginaleffects</code> for IPW. The presentation is very short. Readers who seek a more comprehensive understanding and application of these methods should refer to Noah Greifer\u2019s excellent and detailed work on the topic and to the <code>WeightIt</code> package vignettes and website.</p> <p>To illustrate, we use the Lalonde data.</p> <pre><code>library(marginaleffects)\ndata(\"lalonde\", package = \"MatchIt\")\nhead(lalonde)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>     treat age educ   race married nodegree re74 re75       re78\nNSW1     1  37   11  black       1        1    0    0  9930.0460\nNSW2     1  22    9 hispan       0        1    0    0  3595.8940\nNSW3     1  30   12  black       0        0    0    0 24909.4500\nNSW4     1  27   11  black       0        1    0    0  7506.1460\nNSW5     1  33    8  black       0        1    0    0   289.7899\nNSW6     1  22    9  black       0        1    0    0  4056.4940\n</code></pre> <p>To begin, we use a logistic regression model to estimate the probability that each unit will treated:</p> <pre><code>m &lt;- glm(treat ~ age + educ + race + re74, data = lalonde, family = binomial)\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we call <code>predictions()</code> to extract predicted probabilities. Note that we supply the original <code>lalonde</code> data explicity to the <code>newdata</code> argument. This ensures that all the original columns are carried over to the new dataset: <code>dat</code>. We also create a new column called <code>wts</code> that contains the inverse of the predicted probabilities:</p> <pre><code>dat &lt;- predictions(m, newdata = lalonde)\ndat$wts &lt;- ifelse(dat$treat == 1, 1 / dat$estimate, 1 / (1 - dat$estimate))\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we use linear regression to model the outcome of interest: personal income in 1978 (<code>re78</code>).

To guide marketing and distribution efforts, the company would like to know the share of the population in each city that is interested in tasting meat substitutes.</p> <p>The company conducts a telephone survey of 1000 randomly selected adults from 40 large American cities. For each survey respondent, we record the city of residence, age, level of education, and whether they are interested in tasting meat substitutes. The variable we focus on is \u201cinterest in meat substitutes,\u201d measured on a scale of 1 to 7 where 7 means \u201cvery interested\u201d and 1 means \u201cnot at all interested\u201d. Our ultimate goal is to estimate the average of this 7 point scale for each city.</p> <p>The (simulated) data that we will use is stored in a <code>R</code> data frame called <code>survey</code>.

Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to compute precise city-by-city estimates, because although the number of respondents is large overall, the number of respondents within each of the 40 cities is relatively small. Moreover, the company\u2019s sampling strategy does not guarantee that subsamples are representative of each city\u2019s population.

In this context, the word \u201cmarginal\u201d refers to the idea of a \u201csmall change,\u201d in the calculus sense.</p> <p>A marginal effect measures the association between a change in a regressor x, and a change in the response y.

Predictions, contrasts, marginal effects, and marginal means are functions of the coefficients, so we can use the delta method to estimate standard errors around all of those quantities. Since there are a lot of mathematical treatments available elsewhere, this vignette focuses on the \u201cimplementation\u201d in <code>marginaleffects</code>.</p> <p>Consider the case of the <code>marginal_means()</code> function. When a user calls this function, they obtain a vector of marginal means.
